  title    = "Application of Digital Photogrammetry to Complex Topography for
              Geomorphological Research",
  author   = "Lane, S N and James, T D and Crowell, M D",
  abstract = "This paper is concerned with the application of automated digital
              photogrammetry, using 1:3000 scale photography, to complex,
              natural landform surfaces, of typical interest to
              geomorphologists. It assesses the quality of the results obtained
              using a relatively cheap and readily available area based
              stereomatching package, in terms of precision, accuracy and
              external reliability. Precision is investigated with reference to
              the confidence that can be placed in individual matches. Accuracy
              is evaluated using specially collected, independent datasets
              obtained from an area of complex topography in Glen Affric,
              Scotland. Data collection was stratified to areas of different
              surface roughness. External reliability is judged with respect to
              estimates of slope, a key parameter in geomorphological
              investigations. The results show that, whilst the effects of grid
              density and vegetation correction are the most important controls
              upon the accuracy and the external reliability of the
              photogrammetric results, collection parameters associated with
              the stereomatching process can also exert some control,
              particularly in areas of complex topography. It is impossible to
              generalize rules for choice of optimal collection parameters
              without careful consideration of the surface under investigation.
              Given that maximum grid densities are defined by the object space
              pixel resolution, the paper concludes that surface quality is
              largely governed by traditional controls upon photogrammetric
              data quality (camera calibration, base:distance ratio, ground
              control), combined with either scanning density or digital image
              resolution. However, over some surfaces, careful consideration
              has to be given to the effect of matching parameters.",

               and coastal flooding--a global assessment",
  author    = "Neumann, Barbara and Vafeidis, Athanasios T and Zimmermann,
               Juliane and Nicholls, Robert J",
  abstract  = "Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards
               including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same
               time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and
               exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As
               this trend is expected to continue into the future, we
               investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such
               impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and
               2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year
               2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation
               coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods
               based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios.
               Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas
               against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of
               urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed,
               but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or
               out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine
               spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with
               demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections
               of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the
               number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as
               well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100
               year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India,
               Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the
               highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year
               and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the
               future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest
               rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone,
               particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and
               Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with
               a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help
               identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for
               building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable
               but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further

  abstract  = "The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) is
               affecting a number of critical benefits, or ecosystem services.
               We review the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs,
               including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass
               beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate
               estimates of the key economic values arising from these
               services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs
               impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of ECEs
               across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable
               valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services
               of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves,
               many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes
               and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral
               reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services
               have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient
               transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution
               control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE
               services, such as coastal protection and habitat-fishery
               linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these
               services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the
               connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important
               implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying
               key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of
               erosion, and habitat-fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by
               suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the
               immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the
               connectivity of ECEs across land-sea gradients also influences
               the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the
               entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic
               effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further
               ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE
               services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for
               management, controlling and regulating destructive economic

              topographic data over wide geographical areas is expensive and
              time consuming and often requires highly trained professionals.
              In this study we demonstrate a novel approach combining citizen
              science with low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that reliably
              produces survey-grade morphological data able to model sediment
              dynamics from event to annual scales. The high-energy
              wave-dominated coast of south-eastern Australia, in Victoria, is
              used as a field laboratory to test the reliability of our
              protocol and develop a set of indices to study multi-scale

              sediment as embayed beaches and distinguished between slowed and
              accelerated erosional modes. The data was also able to assess the

              systems with process-response linkages that span temporal scales
              from seconds to millennia and spatial scales from sand grains to
              landscapes, research that integrates knowledge across these
              scales is fairly uncommon. As a result, understanding of
              geomorphic systems is often scale-constrained due to a host of
              methodological, logistical, and theoretical factors that limit
              the scope of how Earth scientists study landforms and broader
              landscapes. This paper reviews recent advances in understanding
              of the geomorphology of beach-dune systems derived from over a
              decade of collaborative research from Prince Edward Island (PEI),
              Canada. A comprehensive summary of key findings is provided from
              short-term experiments embedded within a decade-long monitoring
              program and a multi-decadal reconstruction of coastal landscape
              change. Specific attention is paid to the challenges of scale
              integration and the contextual limitations research at specific
              spatial and/or temporal scales imposes. A conceptual framework is
              presented that integrates across key scales of investigation in
              geomorphology and is grounded in classic ideas in Earth surface
              sciences on the effectiveness of formative events at different
              scales. The paper uses this framework to organize the review of
              this body of research in a `scale aware' way and, thereby,
              identifies many new advances in knowledge on the form and
              function of subaerial beach-dune systems. Finally, the paper
              offers a synopsis of how greater understanding of the
              complexities at different scales can be used to inform the
              development of predictive models, especially those at a temporal
              scale of decades to centuries, which are most relevant to coastal
              management issues. Models at this (landform) scale require an
              understanding of controls that exist at both `landscape' and
              `plot' scales. Landscape scale controls such as sea level change,
              regional climate, and the underlying geologic framework
              essentially provide bounding conditions for independent variables
              such as winds, waves, water levels, and littoral sediment supply.
              Similarly, a holistic understanding of the range of processes,
              feedbacks, and linkages at the finer plot scale is required to
              inform and verify the assumptions that underly the physical
              modelling of beach-dune interaction at the landform scale.",

  abstract = "The concept of coastal sediment compartments was first used in
              the 1960s in the United States. It has since been recognised as
              appropriate for defining sections of the Australian coast, but
              had not been uniformly adopted around the nation in the way that
              has underpinned management, as in other countries. In 2012, the
              Australian Government supported a project to better understand
              coastal sediment dynamics using the sediment compartment approach
              as a framework within which to consider future shoreline
              behaviour and the impacts of climate change, including rising sea
              level, changing wave climates and sediment budgets. This paper
              outlines the sediment compartment project and uses case studies
              to demonstrate its application. The project consisted of three
              steps. The first step involved delineation of a hierarchy of
              coastal sediment compartments following a nationally agreed set
              of criteria, integrating the onshore/offshore geologic framework
              with known patterns of sediment movement and those inferred from
              surface landforms. This identified more than 100 primary
              compartments bounded by major structural features such as
              headlands or changes of shoreline orientation. At a finer scale,
              approximately 350 secondary compartments were identified, many of
              which encompass smaller scale structural features that define
              tertiary scale compartments or cells. For verification of this
              sediment compartments approach to coastal planning and
              management, the second step of the study comprised case studies
              of contrasting compartments with different patterns of sediment
              supply, transport and deposition. The third step, involved
              embedding all secondary compartments around the continental coast
              into the Shoreline Explorer, within the CoastAdapt toolbox
              (National Climate Change Adaption Research Facility). Information
              regarding the sensitivity of shorelines to change was compiled at
              the compartment scale, based upon evidence such as substrate,
              sediment transport attributes and oceanographic forcing,
              including waves, tides and storm processes. Presentation of
              information through CoastAdapt within the compartments framework
              provides a resource to facilitate improved coastal planning and
              management over different implementation levels, from national
              strategy scale down to local policy scale. Case studies from
              several contrasting settings around the Australian coast
              demonstrated the potential and feasible application of the
              sediment compartment approach at different spatial and temporal

  abstract = "Coastal areas suffer degradation due to the action of the sea and
              other natural and human-induced causes. Topographical changes in
              beaches and sand dunes need to be assessed, both after severe
              events and on a regular basis, to build models that can predict
              the evolution of these natural environments. This is an important
              application for airborne LIDAR, and conventional photogrammetry
              is also being used for regular monitoring programs of sensitive
              coastal areas. This paper analyses the use of unmanned aerial
              vehicles (UAV) to map and monitor sand dunes and beaches. A very
              light plane (SwingletCam) equipped with a very cheap, non-metric
              camera was used to acquire images with ground resolutions better
              than 5cm. The Agisoft Photoscan software was used to orientate
              the images, extract point clouds, build a digital surface model
              and produce orthoimage mosaics. The processing, which includes
              automatic aerial triangulation with camera calibration and
              subsequent model generation, was mostly automated. To achieve the
              best positional accuracy for the whole process, signalised ground
              control points were surveyed with a differential GPS receiver.
              Two very sensitive test areas on the Portuguese northwest coast
              were analysed. Detailed DSMs were obtained with 10cm grid spacing
              and vertical accuracy (RMS) ranging from 3.5 to 5.0cm, which is
              very similar to the image ground resolution (3.2--4.5cm). Where
              possible to assess, the planimetric accuracy of the orthoimage
              mosaics was found to be subpixel. Within the regular coastal
              monitoring programme being carried out in the region, UAVs can
              replace many of the conventional flights, with considerable gains
              in the cost of the data acquisition and without any loss in the
              quality of topographic and aerial imagery data.",
